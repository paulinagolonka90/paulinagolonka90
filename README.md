 👋 Hi, I’m @paulinagolonka90
- 👀 I’m interested in manual testing, usability testing, and QA processes. I have a keen eye for detail and a passion for improving the user experience of digital products.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automated testing tools like Selenium to broaden my skill set in QA. I'm also exploring UX/UI design principles to enhance my testing approaches.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in need of quality assurance or any startups looking for thorough testing of their web and mobile applications. I'm eager to bring my manual testing skills to teams that value meticulous work and user-centered design.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at paulina@aplicativ.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulina-golonka-a78387a8/.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I'm really into adult coloring books. I find them to be an excellent way to unwind and de-stress after a long day of testing. Coloring not only allows me to creatively express myself but also aids in concentration and noticing details, which surprisingly translates into my professional skills as a tester.
